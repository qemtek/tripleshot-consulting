# Tripleshot Consulting — Website Improvement Roadmap
_Last updated: 25 June 2025_

---
## Overview
This document gathers **all** feedback and suggestions from our recent conversations (site audit + Bill’s notes) and breaks them into phased, bite‑size tasks. Tick items off as you go, or delegate to the right teammate.

---
## Phase 1 — Trust & Approachability _(Week 1–2)_
- [ ] **Hero redesign** — split‑screen layout (headline + group photo/video)
- [ ] Replace subtitle with a _pain → promise_ sentence (e.g. “Drowning in spreadsheets? We turn chaos into insight in 90 days.”)
- [ ] **Inline team cards** just below hero  
  - [ ] Head‑shot  
  - [ ] 2‑line specialism blurb  
  - [ ] Direct email + Calendly link
- [ ] Ship SVG logo + favicon for crisp rendering

## Phase 2 — Story‑Driven Proof _(Week 2–3)_
- [ ] Draft **three client vignettes** (≈80 words each)
  1. Getting Digital – Bakery order books → tablet app
  2. Unlocking Value – Wholesaler report 6 h → 6 s, £18 k saved
  3. Getting Ahead – Retailer margins +4 %
- [ ] Build short case‑snippet pages (150–200 words, 1 metric, 1 quote)
- [ ] Add “Success Stories” carousel linking to those snippets

## Phase 3 — Navigation & UX _(Week 3–4)_
- [ ] Add sticky top navigation bar: **Services | Case Studies | About | Blog | Contact**
- [ ] Implement Microsoft Clarity or Hotjar for scroll‑depth & click heatmaps
- [ ] Improve typography hierarchy (larger section titles, accent colour)
- [ ] Upgrade CTA buttons to filled primary style with right‑arrow icon

## Phase 4 — SEO & Content Engine _(Week 4–5)_
- [ ] Expand meta‑title to ≈60 chars incl. benefit (e.g. “Data & AI for UK SMBs | Free Audit”)
- [ ] Add FAQ accordion with long‑tail search phrases owners use
- [ ] Launch monthly 600‑word blog series (start: “Affordable AI for UK manufacturers”)
- [ ] Submit XML sitemap to Google Search Console

## Phase 5 — Social Proof & Lead Capture _(Week 5–6)_
- [ ] Add “Trusted by” logo/industry badge strip (anonymise if needed)
- [ ] Insert testimonial carousel (auto‑rotate every 8 s)
- [ ] Offer lead magnet: **AI Readiness Checklist** PDF + email capture form
- [ ] Embed Calendly booking form in CTA section

## Quick Technical To‑Dos (apply anytime)
| Task | Effort | Impact |
|------|--------|--------|
| Branded email + SMTP auth | 1 h | Trust + deliverability |
| SVG logo & favicon | 15 min | Sharper visuals |
| Microsoft Clarity script | 10 min | Behaviour data |
| Compress hero media | 20 min | Faster LCP |
| Ensure semantic heading order | 30 min | Accessibility + SEO |

---
## Copy & Tone Guidelines
* Write like chatting with Bill: contractions, plain English.
* Name the fear, then solve it: “Not sure where to start? 90 % of our clients felt the same.”
* Friendly CTAs > corporate jargon: **“Grab a coffee with Chris”** beats “Schedule discovery call”.

## Templates
### Team Bio Card
| Photo | Name | Specialism | 2‑Line Superpower | Contact |
|-------|------|-----------|-------------------|---------|
| ![ ]() | Chris | Analytics & Dashboards | Turns raw data into decisions in days, not months. | chris@…  /  Calendly |
| ![ ]() | Maria | Process Automation | Replaces 6‑hour spreadsheet rituals with one‑click flows. | maria@…  /  Calendly |
| ![ ]() | Jon | AI & Strategy | Finds tiny tweaks that lift margins 4 %+. | jon@…  /  Calendly |

### Success‑Snippet
> **Title:** _Sam’s bakery: 5 paper books → 1 tablet_
>
> **Problem:** Missed stock alerts cost ~£350 / month.
>
> **Solution:** Two‑day tablet app; SMS when flour < 10 kg.
>
> **Result:** Zero stockouts in 90 days, +6 % revenue.
>
> “Tripleshot spoke plain English and saved my weekends.” — Sam, Owner

---
## Long‑Term Nice‑to‑Haves
- Animated 3‑phase framework graphic
- 90‑second explainer video
- Quarterly webinar series for SMB owners
- Partner badges (AWS, Microsoft, etc.)

---
## Diagnostic Reference (why these tasks matter)
### First‑Impression Snapshot
**What works**  
• Clear promise (“We Make Modernisation Simple”)  
• Memorable three‑phase framework  
• Early contact CTA

**What feels missing**  
• No primary navigation bar  
• Minimal proof (logos / testimonials)  
• Generic Gmail contact lowers trust

### Content & Copy Gaps
- Little specificity on deliverables or metrics
- Tone warm but generic; brand story (why “Tripleshot”?) absent

### Design & UX Issues
- Flat visual hierarchy; CTA blends into body text
- No trust cues above the fold; no sticky header

### SEO & Technical Findings
- Descriptive meta‑title but no benefit CTA
- Zero blog/insights content → thin indexation
- Hero image is raster logo; headings need semantic order

---
## Next Deliverables — pick what’s most useful
1. **Draft copy** (team cards + 3 vignettes)
2. **Wireframe** (Figma link or simple React component)
3. **Dev checklist** with GitHub issues style

_Just let me know which item to start on, and we’ll take it from there!_
